# Ansible Collection - netcloud.ncae

This repository contains the Ansible Collection for the Netcloud Automation Engine, also known as NCAE. It exposes several plugins and roles for interacting with NCAE Core and allows the development of custom modules.

## Usage
Documentation about all the modules and plugins provided by this Ansible collection can be found on the auto-generated documentation hosted on GitHub Pages: **TODO**

As of today, only the inventory plugin `devices` is being provided. All other functionality to interact with NCAE still remains within the `legacy` role, which offers various tasks that can be individually included into your playbook. To find more information about this role, check out [the README file](roles/legacy/README.md) within the directory `roles/legacy`.
