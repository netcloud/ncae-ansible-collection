    description:
        - This module is a CRUD wrapper for NCAE Core around C(/api/automation/v1/upload-file).
        - The C(automation.UploadFile) endpoint is related to NCAE services.
        - The API calls are always made from the Ansible controller as part of an action plugin.
    options:
        name:
            description:
                - Name to be used for storing the file inside NCAE.

            description:
                - Optional path to the file which should be uploaded.

            description:
                - Optional MIME type for the file which is being uploaded.
                - If left empty, the file contents will be analysed for a heuristic detection.
                - If no MIME type can be determined, C(application/octet-stream) is used instead.
            type: str
        service_instance:
            description:
                - Optional ID of service instance to which this file belongs.
                - If left empty, the file is assumed to be at global scope.

        delete_on:
            description:
                - Optional expiration date in C(YYYY-MM-DD) format for file.
                - If not specified, the default file expiration as defined by NCAE Core is used.

        allow_anonymous_download:
            description:
                - Specifies whether the file can be downloaded anonymously.
                - If C(true), the file requires no authentication for downloads.
